Some routers request the format of comment like below:


{_id: COMMENT_ID, recipeId: RECIPE_ID, reciipeTitle: RECIPE_TITLE, name: COMMENT_NAME, poster: COMMENT_POSTER}

I dont know what is name or COMMENT_NAME, I treat it as comment in comment,

Plase run "node task/seed.js" to generate the data in mongodb before run "npm start"
